Used Computer vision's bounding boxes and background substraction to detect moving vehicles at 2 different time frames. 
Tested these results of the above algorithms against 5 to 6 different traffic videos.
Did motion analysis of these bounding boxes using optic flow as well as deep learning.
Outputs from deep learning showed better accuracy in 80% of the cases.
